# React Native Keep Notes App Using react-native-paper, firebase auth, firestore & react-native-simple-store
It is Notes App like a clone of Google Keep. It is made using react-native-paper (a Material UI based library for React Native) & firebase SDK (firebase auth & firestore) & react-native-simple-store(based on AsyncStorage).

To run the app clone the repo. Then go to terminal and type `yarn`, it will install all the npm packages need to run this app. Then type `yarn start` it will open expo developer tool in browser. From there you can run it to android emulator if you have android studio or android sdk & plateform tools. If your laptop and phone are connected to same network you can open it to your phone by downloading Expo Go app and scanning the QR code displayed on expo developer tool.

You can also test this if you don't want to run it on your own system. Just copy this `exp://exp.host/@niceakhtar21/keep-notes` to your device and go to Expo Go App and then you can see the open from clipboard option, click on that and it will open or You can open this link [Keep Notes Expo Link](https://expo.dev/@niceakhtar21/keep-notes) in the browser and open the app in Expo Go by:
